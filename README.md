# ICS_CP_AREA-CALCULATERS

STEPS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE EXCEUTION OF CODE : 
 1 - Firstly,as you run the code ,you will be getting the guidelines as follows :
    " for area of circle         == 1
     for area of square         == 2
     for area of rectangle      == 3
     for area of triangle       == 4
     for area of rhombus        == 5
     for area of Trapezium      == 6
     for area of paralellogram  == 7
     for area of ellipse        == 8
     for area of pentagon       == 9
     for area of hexagon        == 10
     Choose which geometrical shape area do you want to calculate: "
2 - As you are instructed , you have to give any input that suits for which geometrical shape area you want to calculate.
3 - As soon as you select your wanted geometrical shape,it intructs you to give inputs according to the required parameters of the geometrical shape
    For example : If you select circle ,it asks you to give input its radius(parameter).
4 - If you are givn  a negative integer or any invalid input it instructs you that you have entered an invalid input and asks you to input a valid input.
    For example : If your input is any invalid : 
   " Invalid input:Because,Side length cannot be negative.
    please enter valid input "
5 - If your input is valid then it gives you final area.
    For example :
    "Choose which geometrical shape area do you want to calculate:
    1
    Please enter the radius of the circle:
    5
    Area of the circle: 78.50 "
